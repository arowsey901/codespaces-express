        <h2>Who We Are & What We Do</h2>
        <p>My coursework at the University of Memphis was the beginning of my technology journey.  My upcoming Master of Science in Information Technology degree provided me with an arsenal of tools and knowledge to further my business goals. Some of the courses that have prepared me for my career include Computer Networks, Quantitative Risk Analysis, Legal & Ethical Issues in IT, SQL Query Design, Cryptography Concepts and Techniques, Data Visualization and Knowledge Representation, Management of Information Security, Database Design & Data Modeling, Information Systems Project Management, Research and Writing for the IT Professional, System Analysis and Design, and Managing Information Technology in a Business Environment.</p>

                Tech Bytes began in 2011 as a computer repair company. Many word of mouth referrals led to success and expansion. In the beginning, we mostly got computer requests for virus removal and hard drive replacement. Now we have grown to repair cell phones, tablets, smart watches, speakers, televisions, and other electronics. We even accept requests for devices not listed.

                We are a family owned and operated business. We pride ourselves on our honesty, integrity, and quality of work. Our goal is to provide the best service possible at an affordable price. We want our customers to be satisfied with our work and to feel comfortable recommending us to their friends and family.
